2. Install the CLI inside your project via `yarn add -D @namics/remlog-cli`
3. Add a `poststart` script which runs `remlog server -p <preferred-port>`
4. Install the `@namics/remlog-browser-client` if you're in a UI project or `@namics/remlog-utils` if you're in a project with AJAX utils
5. Refer to the [BrowserClient](/packages/browser-client) or [Server](/packages/server#sending-a-trace-to-the-server-via-ajax) package.

Have fun logging!
